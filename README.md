# Terminal-Wordle
Wordle in the terminal! You can do local infinite Wordles, connect to the New York Times page and do todays, or do any Wordle from the archives.

Simply run `WORDLE.PY` with Python, and you're set! The `--help` argument shows more options.

All credit, of course, goes to Josh Wardle, for the creation of the game, and The New York Times Games division for maintaining it. The official link can be found [here](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). I used the Wordle API, at https://www.nytimes.com/svc/wordle/v2/YYYY-MM-DD.json. The word lists, while sourced from the NYT page, was distributed by Cyrus Freshman at their GitHub [page](https://gist.github.com/cfreshman). Your local ANSWERS.TXT and GUESSABLES.TXT should be updated from their page.
